# Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project is aimed at building a predictive model for forecasting stock prices based on historical market data. The goal is to create a tool that assists investors in making well-informed decisions and optimizing their investment strategies.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains historical stock market data for Microsoft. You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasoonkottarathil/microsoft-lifetime-stocks-dataset).

## Project Structure
The project follows the following structure:

- `stock_price_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data collection, preprocessing, model selection, training, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
- `data/`: Directory to store the dataset (not included in the repository due to its size).
- `LICENSE`: A license file (if applicable).

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Download the dataset from the provided Kaggle link and place it in the `data/` directory.
3. Open the `stock_price_prediction.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run the cells in the notebook to perform data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
5. Modify and enhance the code as needed for your specific stock price prediction task.

## Model Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). You can visualize the actual vs. predicted stock prices using the provided code in the notebook.
