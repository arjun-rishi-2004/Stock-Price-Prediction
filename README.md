# Stock Price Prediction Project

## Project Overview

- *Project Name:* Stock Price Prediction
- *Objective:* This project aims to develop a predictive model that forecasts the closing stock price of Microsoft based on historical market data. The goal is to assist investors in making informed decisions and optimizing their investment strategies.

## Problem Statement

In the dynamic world of financial markets, investors are continually seeking ways to gain a competitive edge. This project addresses the challenge of accurately forecasting stock prices, particularly those of Microsoft, using historical market data. By leveraging historical data and advanced predictive modeling techniques, we aim to develop a model that can assist investors in making data-driven investment choices.

## Key Components and Steps

1. *Data Collection*: We'll source historical stock market data for Microsoft, ensuring that it includes essential features such as date, open price, close price, volume, and other pertinent indicators.

2. *Data Preprocessing*: We'll clean and transform the collected data, handling missing values and converting the date column into a datetime format for time series analysis.

3. *Feature Engineering*: We'll create new features, such as moving averages, technical indicators, and lagged variables, to enhance the model's predictive power.

4. *Model Selection*: We'll explore various machine learning and time series forecasting algorithms to identify the most effective model for our task.

5. *Model Training*: With the selected model, we'll train it using a split dataset, fine-tuning its hyperparameters to optimize performance.

6. *Evaluation*: We'll assess the model's accuracy using time series forecasting metrics and visualize actual vs. predicted stock prices.

7. *Deployment*: We'll deploy the trained model for real-time or batch predictions and create a user-friendly interface for accessing predictions.

## Dataset

We will use a meticulously curated dataset containing historical stock market data for Microsoft, ensuring its accuracy and reliability. The dataset should cover a sufficient time frame for meaningful analysis.

## Tools and Technologies

- *Programming Language:* Python
- *Development Platform:* Jupyter Notebook
- *Libraries:* pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib

## Timeline

We've outlined a well-defined project timeline with milestones for each project phase to allocate adequate time for crucial tasks.
